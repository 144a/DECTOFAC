# DECTOFAC

This program uses the idea behind a continued fraction to take a decimal number and convert it into a fraction. It will work with just about any number you give it, however, it doesn't take imaginary inputs, and will not be able to deal with irrational numbers. Instead, it will create a very close approximate to that number within 7-10 decimal places (ex. sqrt(2) = 47321/33461 = 1.414213562).

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
